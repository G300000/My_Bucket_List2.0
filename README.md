# 🪣 My_Bucket_List - Modern MVC Dashboard

A professional, laptop-optimized **Bucket List** application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**. This project follows a strict MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and features a high-end UI/UX using a White, Navy Blue, and Emerald Green color palette.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Executive Dashboard:** A clean, formal laptop-focused layout with a fixed administration sidebar.
* **Real-time Search:** High-performance client-side filtering to find activities instantly.
* **Activity Ledger:** Track your goals with timestamps and status indicators.
* **Status Management:** Mark items as "Completed" to highlight them in **Emerald Green**.
* **Responsive UX:** Optimized for mouse-and-keyboard interaction with smooth micro-interactions.

## 🏗️ The MVC Architecture

This project is organized into three distinct layers to ensure clean code:

* **Model (`Models/BucketItem.cs`):** Defines the data structure (Activity Name, Status, and Timestamp).
* **View (`Views/Home/Index.cshtml`):** The "Super Great" UI/UX using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS for a formal feel.
* **Controller (`Controllers/HomeController.cs`):** The brain that handles the logic for Adding, Toggling, and Deleting records.
